This React project, created during a hackathon and winning the competition, was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). It provides a streamlined way to set up a React application with minimal configuration. Key scripts include `npm start` to run the app in development mode at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000), `npm test` to launch the test runner, and `npm run build` to generate a production-ready build optimized for performance, with minified code and hashed filenames for caching. The `npm run eject` command allows for full control of the configuration, though it's irreversible. For more details on testing, code splitting, bundle size analysis, and deployment, refer to the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).
